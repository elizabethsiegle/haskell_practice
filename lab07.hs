--Write a Haskell program that loops, asking the user for a number and then reporting the numberâ€™s 
--prime factors. Exit when the user enters in something other than a positive number.

--Implement the following utilities in Haskell:

--cat
--echo
--ls, with its -F option
--cp
--(Challenge) Ponder how to take your solution to (1) and add fancy types to it. 
--Note that prime factorization has a simple specification: it takes a number and 
--produces a list of numbers, each of which is prime and the product of which equals the original number. 
--If you have your algorithm run over SNats, you should be able to create a custom list-like GADT for your 
--output that captures these properties. You can then use such a structure to verify your algorithm.
